I see you met Gimny already. He’s a good kid, easy to order around. Makes my life easier.
Since we haven’t formally met before this, I want to make one thing clear. If you help me, I’ll help you. Try anything funny and I have eyes and hands everywhere in this place.
Threatening you? Bah! A second-rate thug threatens, a man like me persuades. I’m sure you understand.
Well enough idle chit-chat for now, my stomach is starting to growl and I’d rather get back to my “work”. Here’s my card, I assure you it’s up to snuff.
