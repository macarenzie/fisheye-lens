Ah it's alright buddy, it's been a while! I would say hope everything has been well, but seeing that you're in prison...
Well since it's your first day cooking I'll help you through your first order! Consider it a welcoming gift from me to you.
First you'll have to check my Punch Card to see if it's up to date. Make sure the day hasn't been punched already, don't wanna give people seconds. (Today is R) 

After you do that most people will tell you what they want to eat. It seems like your selection right now is a bit small, so I'll just have a Sandwich.
To make it, look down (Space) and begin moving the ingredients to the right cooking station (Click the Ingredients and move them to the Cutting Board)....
Oh and if you don't mind, could you please put a knife in the sandwich. I owe Salvator Fini just one more and if he doesn't get it, I don't know what he'll do.
Hey it's alright if you don't give it to me, I understand completely. Don't want to ruin your first day, haha!....
(To put contraband in a dish, open the drawer on the bottom left of your cooking station and put it with the other ingredients.)
