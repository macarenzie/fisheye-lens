Well well well, if it isn’t Chef. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am Salvatore Fini, but you can call me Sal.
I see you met Gimny already. He’s a good kid, easy to order around. Makes my life easier.
Since we haven’t formally met before this, I want to make one thing clear. If you help me, I’ll help you. Try anything funny and I have eyes and hands everywhere in this place.
Threatening you? Bah! A second-rate thug threatens, a man like me persuades. I’m sure you understand.
Well enough idle chit-chat for now, my stomach is starting to growl and I’d rather get back to my “work”. Here’s my card, I assure you it’s up to snuff.
(If denied). You have got to be kidding me Chef! You dare spit in the face of Salvatore Fini?! I’ll see you dead…
(If accepted). Thanks for doing your job properly. Now if you’d be so kind, I would like to have a salad. Oh and throw in extra utensils, if you catch my drift…
(No Contra) You either can’t catch hints, are stupid, or are really stupid. I got my eye on you Chef…
(Contra) Now THAT is a salad. I can see why your parents named you Chef, you’ve got a gift kid. Listen, anyone messes with you and you tell me, okay? I’ll see you around kid, let Gimny know I said “Salutations”.
